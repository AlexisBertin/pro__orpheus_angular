	"introduction":"<p>Listen, Doc. What's with the life preserver? You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.</p><p>What? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. C'mon, c'mon. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. We never would have fallen in love.</p><p>Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Right. Who? Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.</p>",
